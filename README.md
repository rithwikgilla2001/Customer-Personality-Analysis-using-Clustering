# Customer-Personality-Analysis-using-Clustering

This project involves customer segmentation using clustering algorithms on a marketing campaign dataset. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on demographics, behavior, and engagement to support targeted marketing strategies.

Size: ~2,200 records, 30+ features

# Insights:

1. Segmented customers into 4 actionable clusters (~1000, ~500, ~400)
2. Observed distinct behavioral and demographic patterns
3. Out of 331 positive responses to the offer, arounf 97 have been from cluster 0 where the average age is 56.

# Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Clustering Algorithms: KMeans, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, GMM

PCA for dimensionality reduction

Evaluation: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score
